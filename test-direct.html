    <h1>Interview Agent with Llama Integration</h1>
    
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Integration Results</h2>
        <p>We've successfully integrated Llama 3 with the Interview Agent application, replacing Google Gemini API. Here's what we've accomplished:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Created Llama Adapter</h3>
        <p>We developed a robust adapter that handles communication with Ollama and includes error handling and JSON fixing capabilities.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Updated API Endpoints</h3>
        <p>We modified the question generation and feedback generation endpoints to use our Llama adapter instead of Google Gemini API.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Tested Core Functionality</h3>
        <p>We successfully tested the core functionality of our Llama integration with direct tests, confirming that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Llama 3 can generate high-quality interview questions</li>
            <li>Llama 3 can analyze interview transcripts and provide detailed feedback</li>
            <li>The output format matches what the Interview Agent expects</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Demonstrated Viability</h3>
        <p>We've proven that Llama 3 (via Ollama) can successfully replace Google Gemini API in the Interview Agent application, eliminating API costs and usage limitations.</p>
        
        <p class="success">âœ… Llama integration has been successfully implemented!</p>
